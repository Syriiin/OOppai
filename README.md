# Deprecation note
This project is no longer maintained as oppai has been rewritten to be far smaller and more efficient as oppai-ng (https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng).

I recommend you instead use my rewrite for oppai-ng, oppaipy (https://github.com/Syriiin/oppaipy)

For more details on the difference between oppai (OOppai) and oppai-ng (oppaipy), see this comparison: https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng#oppai-ng-vs-old-oppai

# OOppai
Small object oriented wrapper for the pyoppai binding of oppai (https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai).

OOppai provides a more pythonic interface at the expense of a small time increase on calculations.
